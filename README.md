# OneClickEnchantScroll
**A World of Warcraft UI AddOn**

OCES provides a button in your tradeskill window to directly create enchantment scrolls. Also displays the number of enchanting vellums in your inventory on it.

I cannot guarantee compatibility with other tradeskill addons that replace or heavily modify the original tradeskill UI. If you're experiencing issues with another Tradeskill Addon, drop a comment and I'll look into it.

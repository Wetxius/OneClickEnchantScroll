# OneClickEnchantScroll
**A World of Warcraft UI AddOn**

OCES provides a button in your tradeskill window to create enchantment scrolls with a single click. The button also displays the number of enchanting vellums in your inventory and shows the tooltip of the scroll that will be created. You may also link the scroll item by shift-clicking the button.

I cannot guarantee compatibility with other tradeskill addons that replace or heavily modify Blizzard's default tradeskill UI. If you're experiencing issues with another Tradeskill Addon, drop a comment on [Curse](http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/oces), [WoWInterface](http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info18907-OneClickEnchantScroll.html#comments) or [GitHub](https://github.com/patrickjDE/OneClickEnchantScroll/issues) and I'll look into it.
